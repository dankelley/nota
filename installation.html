<p>The stable version is stored on <a
    href="http://pypi.python.org/nota">pypy.python.org</a>, and can be
installed with the <code>pip</code> system command. Most systems will already
have python installed, but it may be necessary to install <code>pip</code>
also. Do that with
<pre>
sudo easy_install pip
</pre>
in a unix shell. This must only be done once; after that, the <code>pip</code> command will be available for installing any python package on pypi.</p>

<p>Now that the OS is set up, it's time to install <code>nota</code> itself. This is done with
<pre>
sudo pip install nota
</pre>
or, if you are upgrading to a new version, use
<pre>
sudo pip install nota --upgrade
</pre>
</p>

<p>At this point, you may use <code>nota</code> as e.g. below, to list notes:
<pre>
nota
</pre>
</p>

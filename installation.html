<p>The stable version is stored on
[pypy.python.org](http://pypi.python.org/nota), and can be installed with the
<code>pip</code> system command. Most systems will already have python
installed, but it may be necessary to install <code>pip</code> also. Do that
with</p>
<pre>
sudo easy_install pip
</pre>
<p>in a unix shell. This must only be done once; after that, the <code>pip</code> command will be available for installing any python package on pypi.</p>

<p>Now that the OS is set up, it's time to install <code>nota</code> itself. This is done with</p>
<pre>
sudo pip install nota
</pre>
or, if you are upgrading to a new version, use
<pre>
sudo pip install nota --upgrade
</pre>

<p>At this point, you may use <code>nota</code> as e.g. below, to list notes:</p>
<pre>
nota
</pre>

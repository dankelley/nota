<p>The stable version is stored on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nota">
    pypy.python.org</a>, and can be installed with the <code>pip</code> system
command. Most systems will already have python installed, but it may be
necessary to install <code>pip</code> also. Do that with</p>
<pre>
sudo easy_install pip
</pre>
<p>in a unix shell. This must only be done once; after that, the <code>pip</code> command will be available for installing any python package on pypi.</p>

<p>Now that the OS is set up, it's time to install <code>nota</code> itself. This is done with</p>
<pre>
sudo pip install nota
</pre>
<p>or, if you are upgrading to a new version, use</p>
<pre>
sudo pip install nota --upgrade
</pre>

<p>At this point, you may use <code>nota</code> as e.g. below, to list notes:</p>
<pre>
nota
</pre>

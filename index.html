<p><code>nota</code> is a python application for note taking. It is designed
for people who do their work at the command line, are comfortable with
plain-text editors such as vim and emacs, and choose to use open-source
software. If you prefer GUI systems, you may as well stop reading now.  If not,

<p>NB. the letters at the start of this paragraph stand for the Latin phrase
<i>nota bene</i>, the first word of which explains the name of the application.
Most people pronounce <code>nota</code> as in "not a chance," but Canadians
might pronounce it as in "ready or not, eh."</p>

<p>A simple way to report a bug is to email a report to <a
    href="mailto:dan.kelley@dal.ca">Dan Kelley@Dal.Ca</a>.  However, people who
are comfortable with web interfaces are highly encouraged to instead use the <a
    href="http://github.com/dankelley/nota/issues">nota development site</a> to
report bugs, because that makes it much easier to track the bug fix.  The
development site also lists previous bug reports, so it can be a good place to
look to see if your bug has already been reported.</p>

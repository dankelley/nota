<p>Nota is written in the <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> language,
and stores its data in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html">Sqlite3</a>
format. These systems use an open-source model and in very wide use, and so
<code>nota</code> users should not be worried about the foundation disappearing
if a company goes bankrupt. The <code>nota</code> code is also released under
an open-source license.</p>

<p>Interested users can track the development of <code>nota</code> on its <a
    href="http://github.com/dankelley/nota">development website</a> website.
That's also the place to report bugs, to suggest new features, and to suggest
patches that can improve <code>nota</code> or the present webpage.</p>

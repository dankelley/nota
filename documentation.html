<h2>Getting started</h1>

<p>When you first use <code>nota</code>, it will create a (sqlite) database for
you.  By default this will be in a the file <code>~/Dropbox/nota.db</code>,
although it's possible to set the file name with the <code>--database</code>
option or, better, as named in a <code>~/.notarc</code> file, in a line like
<pre>
database = "~/nota.db"
</pre>
perhaps. In any case, the database will be populated with tables that will store note items and keywords. 

<h2>Adding notes<h2>

<p>To add a note, try using
<pre>
nota -a
</pre>
which will launch an editor (as defined in your <code>EDITOR</code> shell variable) that invites you to fill in some content. The file contains comments that explain where you should enter a title, keywords, and content; you can also enter a due date, if you like.
</p>

<h2>Listing notes</h2>
Typing
<pre>
nota
</pre>
will display the note we just added. At the start of the display is a ``hash'' code that
identifies the note. The hash will be 7 characters long, as is always the case
when a single note is being displayed. However, if you add a second note and list
the notes, you'll get an abbreviated form that gives a shortened hash, plus the title,
plus the keywords (the last within square brackets).</p>

<p>To display a single note, give its hash code in the call, e.g. if the hash
is <code>ab</code>, type
<pre>
nota ab
</pre>
You can get the same results with just a leading part of the hash code, so long
as it is sufficient to identify the note.</p>

<p>It is also possible to get a list of notes containing a given keyword, e.g. to get 
notes with the keyword <code>ocean</code>, try
<pre>
nota -k ocean
</pre>
Note that keywords are matched using a ``fuzzy'' algorithm, so partial words often also work.
</p>

<h2>Editing notes</h2>

<p>To edit a note, use the <code>-e</code> argument, e.g.
<pre>
nota -e ab
</pre>
will open an editor to let you alter the note specified by the hash
<code>ab</code>. If the hash code matches several notes, an error message will
be provided to tell you to use more characters in the hash code.  </p>

<h2>Deleting notes</h2>

<p>The <code>-d</code> is used to delete notes, e.g.
<pre>
nota -d ab
</pre>

will delete the note.  Actually, what it does is to move it to a trash bin. If
you relist the notes, you'll see that the trash now has contents. You can see
what's in the trash with
<pre>
nota --trash
</pre>

<p>If you wish to undelete a note in the trash, use e.g.
<pre>
nota --undelete ab
</pre>
but, on the other hand, if you're sure the trash contains nothing you'll ever
need again, you can empty it with
<pre>
nota --emptytrash
</pre>

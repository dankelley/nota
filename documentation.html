<h2>A sample session</h1>

<p>A good way to learn how to use <code>nota</code> is to follow along in the
steps given below.</p>

<p>The first thing you should do is to save a note.  This may be done with e.g.
<pre>
nota -a
</pre>
which will launch an editor (as defined in your <code>EDITOR</code> shell variable) that invites you to fill in some content. The file contains comments that explain where you should enter a title, keywords, and content; you can also enter a due date, if you like. If you prefer to add the note entirely from the commandline, use e.g.
<pre>
nota -a -t="First note" -c="Say something wise." -k="test,silly"
</pre>
Here, <code>-t</code> indicates a title, <code>-c</code> some content, and
<code>-k</code> a comma-separated list of keywords.</p>

<p>It is also possible to add notes interactively (with <code>nota</code>
opening the text editor specified by the <code>EDITOR</code> shell variable),
but this is more difficult to illustrate here.</p>

<p>With either entry method, <code>nota</code> will tell you the name of the
database it created for you.  This file will be used in future calls, unless
you tell <code>nota</code> to use another file with the <code>--database</code>
argument (or in the configuration file <code>~/.notarc</code>).</p>

<p>Typing
<pre>
nota
</pre>
will display the note that was just added. It will look something like
<pre>
d93e188: First note [test, silly]
  created 2015-03-01 13:35:34 
  Say something wise.

The trash is empty.
Hint: list note with hash 'ab...': 'nota ab'
</pre>
At the start of the display is a ``hash'' code that identifies the note. The
hash will be 7 characters long, as is always the case when a single note is
being displayed. The hash you see will differ from that shown here, because
it depends on the creation date.</p>

<p>Now, add a second note
<pre>
nota -a -t="Second note" -c="Something wiser." -k="test,wiser"
</pre>
and check the listing:
<pre>
nota
</pre>
yields
<pre>
d: First note [test, silly]
6: Second note [test, wiser]
The trash contains 1 note.
Hint: add a note: 'nota -a' (opens EDITOR)
</pre>
where, again, your hash will differ and probably the hint, also. Notice that
the hashes have been abbreviated in this display. The letter <code>d</code> is
sufficient to indicate the first note in this context, so only that is
displayed. (As more notes are entered, <code>nota</code> will start displaying
two characters in the hash, and even more as time goes on.)</p>

<p>We can examine the first note in detail with this abbreviated hash:
<pre>
nota d
</pre>
yields the initial display of that note. If, as more notes are added,
<code>d</code> indicates more than one note, then <code>nota</code> returns to
the summary format.</p>

<p>Notes can be listed by keyword, e.g.
<pre>
nota -k test
</pre>
displays both notes (in summary format), while
<pre>
nota -k silly
</pre>
details just the first note, in detail format.</p>

<p>Of course, your notes won't be perfect, and you may want to edit them to fix
errors or add new material. This is done with e.g.
<pre>
nota -e d
</pre>
to revise the first note. If the hash code corresponds to just one note, this
will open up a text editor, in which you will be able to change the note title,
contents, keywords, etc. There is also a <code>DUE</code> item that you can
set, for notes that are plans.</p>

<p>A note may be deleted by e.g.
<pre>
nota -d d
</pre>

and, again, this works only if the hash identifies only one note. If so, the
note is moved to the trash, where it may be seen with 
<pre>
nota --trash
</pre>
and possibly undeleted with
<pre>
nota --undelete d
</pre>

<p>This should be enough to get you going. Try practicing with a few silly
notes before you use <code>nota</code> seriously. There is no harm in retaining
the database that was set up in your tests, but you can always delete (or,
better, rename) it to start afresh. The following sections discuss
<code>nota</code> a bit more systematically.</p>

<h2>Advanced topics<h2>

The trash may be emptied with
<pre>
nota --emptytrash
</pre>

<p>Notes may be shared by a combination of <code>--export</code> and
<code>--import</code> operations.  To share a note with hash <code>ab</code>,
use
<pre>
nota --export ab > ab.json
</pre>
and email or otherwise provide the new (textual) file named
<code>nb.json</code> to another person. That second person then does
<pre>
nota --import ab.json
</pre>
to insert the note into his/her database. Naturally, this can be done by a
single user, to copy notes from one database to another. Note that the
newly-created note has a new date of creation and a new hash code.</p>

<p><code>nota</code> may be customized with commandline arguments, and also
with entries in a resource file named <code>~/.notarc</code>, which can contain
various customization features. For example, including the following in that
file changes the default color theme
<pre>
color = "forest"
</pre>
although if <code>nota</code> is invoked with the <code>--color</code>
argument, then the latter will be used.
